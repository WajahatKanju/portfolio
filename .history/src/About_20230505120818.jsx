      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a coding enthusiast. I have a deep passion for all things related to computers and spend most of my time working on various coding projects. In addition to my love for technology, I also enjoy traveling and hiking.

      <p>
        I started my coding journey at the age of 13 and have since honed my skills through a variety of experiences. I have completed several projects on freecodecamp and earned certificates from Coursera. I have also tried out the Microverse program and have experience with automation using Selenium.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am always eager to learn more and expand my skillset. Whether it's tackling a new coding challenge or exploring a new part of the world, I am excited for the opportunities that the future holds.
